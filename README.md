_minhdh, HCMC 2019_

The data can be download at [Cinnamon AI Challenge](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qa2YA6w6V5MaNV-qxqhsHHoYFRK5JB39)

Please unzip the data in this folder structure to run the code:

```
|--data/
|----raw/
|------0825_DataSamples_1/
|------0916_DataSamples_2/
|------1015_Private_Test/
|--src/
```

The solution is mainly based on [Arthur Flor's Solution](https://medium.com/@arthurflor23/handwritten-text-recognition-using-tensorflow-2-0-f4352b7afe16) on another datasets. Also many thanks to [@pbcquoc](https://github.com/pbcquoc), the winner on the challenge, for his [sharing](https://pbcquoc.github.io/vietnamese-ocr/).
